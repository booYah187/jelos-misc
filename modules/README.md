scripts to add "music player" and "sort systems" to tools menu. add .sh files to /storage/.config/modules. respective boxart in img folder.

"sort systems" is simply a shortcut to copy over my customized es_systems.cfg and refresh after performing updates. don't forget to add your es_systems.cfg path.

only reason for music player is i prefer to launch the app from tools as opposed to having a dedicate music system.
